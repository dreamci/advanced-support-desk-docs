## 📥 Email Import (IMAP/POP3) Setup

To automatically create tickets from incoming emails, follow these steps:

1. **Configure a Department**  
   In your Filament admin panel, navigate to **Support > Departments**.  
   Create a new department and fill in the *Mail Import* section with your IMAP or POP3 server credentials.  
   Enable the **Mail Import Enabled** toggle.

2. **Schedule the Fetch Command**  
   The plugin includes an Artisan command to fetch mail.  
   You need to schedule it to run periodically in your `app/Console/Kernel.php` file.

3. **Ensure Your Scheduler is Running**  
   Make sure you have a single cron entry on your server to run the Laravel scheduler,  
   as described in the Laravel documentation.

## 🔒 Permissions

The plugin defines two levels of access:

- **Global Admin** → Can see and manage all tickets from all departments.  
- **Department Admin** → Can only see and manage tickets assigned to their department or directly to them.
